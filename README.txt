Scripting Exercise - Lab 2

I have followed the tutorial present in the slides and I have added things present in the second tutorial to make the game more entertaining and dynamic.

Regarding the aspect of the game I have added the following functionalities:
- I add the camera shake that occurs every 10 seconds and the sheep spawn faster during the shaking
- Added a rotating animation to sheep when hit, enhancing the visual effect as they disappear


The project build is in the Release folder
